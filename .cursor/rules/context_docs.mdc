• Always use the context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries like Pydantic Al and Streamlit. 
• For the tokens, start with 5000 but then increase to 20000 if yourfirst search didn't give relevant documentation. 
• Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search.
