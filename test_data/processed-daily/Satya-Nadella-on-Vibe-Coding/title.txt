Okay, here are a few title options for that audio content:

**Short & Catchy:**

*   Retro Computing Rebooted
*   Altair Basic: AI's Take
*   Quantum Altair?

**More Descriptive:**

*   Microsoft's First Product: An AI Retrospective
*   Recreating Altair BASIC with GitHub Copilot
*   From Altair to Quantum: an AI Assisted Journey

**My Recommendation:**

I like "**Retro Computing Rebooted**" as it's concise, intriguing, and accurately reflects the content.
