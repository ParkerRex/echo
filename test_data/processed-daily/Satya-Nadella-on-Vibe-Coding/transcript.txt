So, we're going to learn a little bit about Microsoft's history with its first product or the creation of its first product. Let's go to Copilot. First product. Altair Basic. April 4th, 1975. Ingenious combination of technical skill and resourcefulness. Wow, they didn't even have direct access to an Altair. I have one actually. I don't know if it works. I can switch it on. Oh man, it does switch on. I kind of have an Altair, but I don't think I can make it work. I guess, what do I have? I'll use Code Spaces and get up Copilot. Create an emulator. Give me the plan. All right, let's see what it says. Wow. Phase one, research and setup, core components, integration, optimization. Oh man, that's a lot of work. So let's say, all right, I just want to write code it. Here I am on GitHub. Let's create the emulator, it's created the templates. Here is the app. All right, let's just run it. Hey, look at that, retro look. Wow. Welcome. You got Hello World, welcome to Altair Basic. Let's see if it actually does some math. Okay, I guess four squares are 16. Math test complete. It works. I guess it didn't take us six weeks. Emulate Q Sharp also on the Altair. I'm sure this will break even. Copilot, let's give it. Let's see what it does. But it's going. I'm going to be able to do Quantum on the Altair. This is so cool.
