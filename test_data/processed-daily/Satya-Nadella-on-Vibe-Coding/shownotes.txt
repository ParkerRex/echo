*   **0:52-0:55**: Planning to use Code Spaces and GitHub Copilot.
*   **0:55-1:00**: Requesting Copilot to create an emulator and provide a plan.

**Copilot and Altar Emulator**

*   **1:01-1:03**: Okay, let's see what it says.
*   **1:03-1:06**: Phase one: research and set up, core components, integration and optimization.
*   **1:06-1:08**: Oh man, that's a lot of work.
*   **1:08-1:10**: I, I just want to write code.
*   **1:10-1:12**: Speaker on GitHub.
*   **1:12-1:17**: The emulator has been created, the templates have been created.
*   **1:17-1:19**: Here is the App.
*   **1:19-1:22**: All right, let's just run it.
*   **1:22-1:24**: Look at that retro look.

*   **1:27-1:29**: Hey, hello world, welcome to Altair Basic.
*   **1:29-1:32**: Lets see if it actually does some math.
*   **1:32-1:36**: Okay, I guess 4 squares are 16, math test complete.
*   **1:36-1:38**: It works.
*   **1:38-1:40**: I guess it didn't take us six weeks.

**Emulation and Quantum**

*   **1:41-1:43**: Emulate.
*   **1:43-1:46**: Q Sharp.
*   **1:46-1:48**: Also, on the Altar.
*   **1:48-1:51**: I'm sure this will break even.
*   **1:51-1:52**: Copilot, let's give it.
*   **1:52-1:54**: Let's see what it does.
*   **1:54-1:55**: But it's going.
*   **1:56-1:58**: I'm going to be able to do quantum on the Altair.
*   **1:58-2:00**: This is so cool.
