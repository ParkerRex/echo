00:00:656 --> 00:07:466
So, we're going to learn a little bit about Microsoft's history with its first product or the creation of its first product.
00:07:686 --> 00:09:946
Let's go to co-pilot.
00:10:106 --> 00:12:306
First product.
00:12:816 --> 00:15:096
Altair Basic.
00:15:526 --> 00:18:516
April 4th, 1975.
00:18:946 --> 00:22:926
genius combination of technical skill and resourcefulness.
00:23:996 --> 00:27:876
Wow, they didn't have direct access to an Altair.
00:27:876 --> 00:30:786
I have one actually.
00:30:786 --> 00:32:626
I don't know if it works.
00:32:626 --> 00:37:246
I can switch it on for man it does switch on.
00:37:246 --> 00:39:816
I kind of have an Altair.
00:40:346 --> 00:43:066
But I don't think I can make it work.
00:43:836 --> 00:46:586
I guess what do I have?
00:46:586 --> 00:49:236
I'll use code spaces and get up co-pilot.
00:49:956 --> 00:52:216
Create an emulator.
00:53:086 --> 00:55:216
Give me the plan.
00:55:756 --> 00:57:006
All right, let's see what it says.
00:58:286 --> 00:59:686
Wow.
00:59:896 --> 01:02:946
Phase one, research and setup.
01:02:946 --> 01:07:646
Core components, integration and optimization.
01:07:646 --> 01:10:606
Oh man, that's a lot of work.
01:10:606 --> 01:12:696
So let's say, all right, I just want to write code it.
01:13:376 --> 01:14:996
Here I am in GitHub.
01:16:276 --> 01:18:426
Let's it's created the emulator.
01:18:426 --> 01:21:166
It's created the templates.
01:21:416 --> 01:22:786
Here is the app.
01:23:686 --> 01:27:046
All right, let's just run it.
01:27:376 --> 01:29:406
Hey, look at that retro look.
01:29:756 --> 01:31:316
Wow.
01:31:316 --> 01:32:596
Welcome.
01:32:946 --> 01:36:006
Let's try hello world, welcome to Altair Basic.
01:36:006 --> 01:38:466
Let's see if it actually does some math.
01:38:716 --> 01:40:046
Okay, I guess four squares are 16.
01:40:726 --> 01:42:706
Math test complete.
01:43:366 --> 01:45:026
It works.
01:45:266 --> 01:47:056
I guess it didn't take us six weeks.
01:50:793 --> 01:52:913
Emulate Q Sharp.
01:54:383 --> 01:55:833
also on the Altair.
01:56:393 --> 01:59:383
I'm sure this will break even.
01:59:563 --> 02:00:473
Co-pilot.
02:00:803 --> 02:03:143
Let's give it.
02:03:223 --> 02:05:023
Let's see what it does.
02:05:263 --> 02:06:433
But it's going.
02:07:663 --> 02:11:633
I'm going to be able to do quantum on the Altair.
02:11:903 --> 02:14:313
This is so cool.
