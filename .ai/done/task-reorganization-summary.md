   - Key achievements and impact documentation

2. **`.ai/doing/backend-frontend-sync-tasks.md`**
   - Organized remaining tasks by phase and priority
   - Added time estimates and verification criteria
   - Included TanStack Start configuration tasks
   - Added execution strategy and success metrics

3. **`.ai/done/original-comprehensive-tasks.md`**
   - Moved original 721-line task file for reference
   - Preserves complete original documentation
