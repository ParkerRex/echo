# Progress

## What Works

- Core pipeline for automated video upload, AI metadata generation, and YouTube publishing is implemented.
- Docker-based local development environment is functional and matches production.
- Real-time frontend UI for upload, progress tracking, and content management is operational.
- Integration with Google Cloud (GCS, Eventarc, Cloud Run, Firestore) and Vertex AI (Gemini) is established.
- Comprehensive test suite and scripts for integration and unit testing are available.

## What's Left to Build

- Expand AI-driven features: content idea generation, script creation, and multi-platform distribution.
- Enhance analytics and performance monitoring.
- Improve user-facing features: more robust title/thumbnail selection, advanced editing tools.
- Continue to refine and document system patterns and technical decisions as the project evolves.

## Current Status

- Memory Bank initialized and up to date.
- All core documentation files created and populated.
- No outstanding code changes; focus is on maintaining documentation accuracy.

## Known Issues

- Some long-term roadmap features (idea generation, analytics, multi-platform support) are not yet implemented.
- Ongoing need to keep documentation synchronized with project changes.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Adopted event-driven, cloud-native architecture for scalability and reliability.
- Prioritized Docker parity between local and production environments.
- Committed to maintaining a comprehensive Memory Bank for context continuity and onboarding.
