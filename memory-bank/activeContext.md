# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing the Memory Bank with core documentation files to ensure project continuity and clarity.
- Capturing project objectives, product context, system patterns, technology stack, and progress status.
- No pending code changes at this stage; focus is on documentation accuracy.

## Recent Changes

- Created and populated the following Memory Bank files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md

## Next Steps

- Complete initialization by creating `progress.md` with a snapshot of current status and known issues.
- Maintain and update all Memory Bank files as the project evolves.
- Ensure that every significant architectural, technical, or product decision is reflected in the Memory Bank.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The Memory Bank is the single source of truth for project context and must be kept up to date.
- Documentation should be updated after every major change, feature addition, or learning.

## Patterns & Preferences

- Use Markdown for all documentation.
- Follow the established Memory Bank file structure and update workflow.

## Learnings & Insights

- A well-maintained Memory Bank enables seamless onboarding, context recovery, and effective project management.
