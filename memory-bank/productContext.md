# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Manual video publishing to YouTube is time-consuming and error-prone, especially when generating high-quality metadata (transcripts, titles, chapters, descriptions). Inconsistent metadata can hurt discoverability and user engagement.

This project solves these problems by automating the entire pipeline—from video upload to AI-powered metadata generation and YouTube publishing—ensuring speed, consistency, and scalability.

## Problems Solved

- Eliminates manual metadata creation and upload steps.
- Ensures consistent, high-quality metadata for every video.
- Reduces time-to-publish and human error.
- Provides real-time feedback and transparency throughout the process.

## How It Should Work

- Users drag-and-drop `.mp4` files or select them for upload.
- The system processes videos automatically, generating all required metadata using AI.
- Users monitor progress in real time via a modern frontend UI.
- Users can review, select, and edit AI-generated titles and thumbnails.
- Finalized videos are uploaded to YouTube with all metadata and captions.

## User Experience Goals

- Simple, intuitive upload and management interface.
- Real-time progress tracking and feedback.
- Easy selection and editing of AI-generated content (titles, thumbnails, etc.).
- Reliable, transparent, and scalable workflow for all users.
