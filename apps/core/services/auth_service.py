# DEPRECATED: Legacy password-based authentication service
# This file has been deprecated in favor of Supabase authentication.
# Google OAuth is now the primary authentication method.
#
# Migration completed:
# - Password-based authentication removed
# - User registration/login now handled by Supabase
# - JWT validation handled by supabase_auth.py
#
# This file is kept for reference during the migration period
# and will be removed in a future cleanup.
